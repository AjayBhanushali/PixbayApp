Pixbay is a simple app to show images depending on the search text.

- [x] Search Images 
- [x] Pagination
- [x] Page View for Images
- [x] See Recent Searches
- [x] Dark Mode Support

## Tech Specs

- [x] VIPER
- [x] Code based UI development (No xib, no No storyoard)
- [x] Caching of images
- [x] Storing of searched results (Using CoreData)
- [x] Useful Extensions

## Implementation Description

Things taken care at the development.

1. Modular: I have tried to split the design in views and hence implemented each of the view object in a UIView class. So that it can be used anywhere from a tableviewcell to collectionview cell to any viewcontroller's view. 
2. Gitable: Tried to maintain sanity of modularity using git branches with the concept of having to generic, feature[s], UI[s] based branching.
3. Discardable: Using VIPER, any part of the code can be discarded.
4. Dependancy Inversion: Wrappers for using different APIs such as NetworkService, CoreData, NSLayoutconstraints
5. POP: Protocol Oriented Programming
6. Single Responsibility: Separation of members depending on the responsibilities.

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0, 12.0+
